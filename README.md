## Datasets

The datasets are from [GCN-Align](https://github.com/1049451037/GCN-Align), [JAPE](https://github.com/nju-websoft/JAPE), and [RSNs](https://github.com/nju-websoft/RSN).

* ent_ids_1: ids for entities in source KG;
* ent_ids_2: ids for entities in target KG;
* ref_ent_ids: entity links encoded by ids;
* triples_1: relation triples encoded by ids in source KG;
* triples_2: relation triples encoded by ids in target KG;
